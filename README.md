# ShouxShot
A screenshotter made in C++\
Note: I don't expect this to be used practically. I simply created it for enjoyment.\
\
How it works:\
Click the 'Take Screenshot' button.\
\
It will create an invisible window that takes up the space of all your monitors combined. This window will capture the clicks for the screenshot area.\
\
Click any point and then click another point. These 2 points will be your screenshot area.\
\
The invisible window will close and your image will be saved as a PNG.
